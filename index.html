                    <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    <p>I moved around a lot growing up—different cities across India before eventually ending up in Ireland. The Leaving Certificate happened, and I got 613 points. It was good, I guess. 625 is the max, so I was happy enough with where I landed.</p>
                    <p>When I was around 13, I started messing around with programming. Just simple stuff—online courses, trying to build little games in Python and Java. Honestly, most of them didn't work, but I kept at it because it was fun. Then a friend and I decided to do something ridiculous: buy a cheap 3D printer from overseas, ship it to Ireland, and build a drone. We had absolutely no clue what we were doing. It took forever, broke multiple times, but eventually we got something flying.</p>
                    <p>I thought mechanical engineering would be my thing because I liked building stuff. But putting that drone together made me realize I was more interested in how it decided what to do, not just how it moved. That's when electronics started making more sense to me.</p>

                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>Looking back, I don't think there was one moment where everything changed. It was just a bunch of small things—trying stuff, failing at most of it, occasionally getting something to work. The people I met along the way taught me way more than I could've learned on my own. I still don't have it all figured out. But I'm okay with that. I'm learning to be okay with not knowing, with making mistakes, with asking for help. That's probably the most important thing I've learned through all of this.</p>

                    <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    <p>Engineering seemed like the obvious choice, but I didn't really get it until I joined Formula Trinity Autonomous in 2021. That's when things started clicking.</p>
                    <p>I worked on control systems—PID controllers, MPC, Pure Pursuit—all the algorithms that tell the car what to do. It was hard. Really hard. There were so many late nights where nothing worked. Eventually I ended up leading the control department, and then became Captain of the autonomous team in 2024. Not because I was the best, but because I'd been there long enough and cared enough to keep showing up.</p>
                    <p>Formula Student is brutal. We failed. A lot. Three years of competitions where things just didn't work. Then at Silverstone in 2024, we finally completed a lap. We got Best Design, which was amazing. But honestly? The award that meant the most was Most Cones Knocked. It sounds like a joke, but those cones represent every single mistake we made along the way. We hit a lot of cones. We learned from every single one.</p>

                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>Those three years were rough. There were times I wanted to quit, times I thought we'd never get it right. But the team kept me going—we were all in it together, all equally confused and tired. When that lap finally happened, it wasn't this triumphant moment. It was more like relief mixed with disbelief. Like, "Wait, it actually worked?" The friendships from Formula Trinity are what I'll remember most. Not the awards, not the lap. The people who stayed up with me until 3 AM debugging controller code. Those are the things that mattered.</p>

                    <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    <p>I got the Laidlaw Research and Leadership Scholarship, which still feels a bit surreal. It meant I could do actual research under Prof. Harun Siljak, who knows way more about this stuff than I ever will.</p>
                    <p>We looked at adaptive network systems. The basic idea: instead of trying to control every single part of a complex network, what if you just place a few adaptive nodes strategically? Can that be enough to stabilize everything? It's like trying to influence a crowd by placing a few people in the right spots instead of trying to manage everyone individually.</p>
                    <p>We built models, ran a bunch of simulations, wrote up what we found. Turns out the idea works—you can stabilize complex systems with way less control than you'd think. Published some reflections and a poster on it. The math was pretty, even if I spent weeks confused about most of it.</p>

                <div class="genuine-section">
                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>I still can't believe I got that scholarship sometimes. Working with someone who actually knows what they're doing made me realize how much I don't know. The research was confusing for a long time—lots of dead ends and ideas that didn't pan out. But when things finally started making sense, when the simulations actually worked, that felt good. Not because I did something amazing, but because I stuck with something that was hard and didn't give up when I felt lost.</p>

                    <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    <p>I needed money while studying in Dublin. Thought working at a pub would be easy. It was not. I lasted maybe a few shifts before realizing I was completely out of my depth. The pace, the noise, the chaos—I have so much respect for people who do that work.</p>
                    <p>After that, I joined RampInfoTech, a small startup doing automation and digital tools for companies. I worked as a developer and sort of a product manager, which meant talking to clients and trying to understand what they actually needed. Built a container tracking system that saved them a bunch of manual work—tracking thousands of shipments automatically instead of doing it by hand. Also made a travel and expense tool for internal stuff. Learned Python, Power BI, SQL, APIs. But mostly I learned how to talk to people and work with teams that were all over the place—some in Ireland, some offshore.</p>
                    <p>Then I went to Zagreb, Croatia to work with Radiona.org. They're a non-profit trying to make tech and hardware more accessible to everyone. I worked on FPGAs—specifically trying to get a deep learning model running on a cheap FPGA board called ULX3S. The idea was to show that you don't need expensive hardware to do advanced stuff. Coming from software and robotics, I'd always noticed how access to tools determines who gets to build things. This felt like a small way to change that.</p>
                    <p>Did a lot of Verilog, ran simulations, tried to squeeze a super-resolution model onto hardware that really wasn't designed for it. Also helped make some guides for people trying FPGAs for the first time. It was messy, but good messy.</p>

                <div class="genuine-section">
                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>The pub thing was humbling. I genuinely thought I could handle it. I couldn't. RampInfoTech was where I started understanding that writing code is one thing, but making something people actually want to use is completely different. I messed up a lot, had to redo things, learned to ask better questions. Croatia was special. Not because I did anything groundbreaking, but because I got to work on something that felt like it mattered—making tech accessible to people who wouldn't otherwise have access. That meant something to me.</p>

                    <h3>What I Did</h3>
                    <p>I did a placement at Jaguar Land Rover, working with the Assisted and Autonomous Driving team. Specifically, the AI Onboard Perception group—basically working on how the car "sees" and understands what's around it using sensors.</p>
                    <p>Daily routine was mostly reading research papers (understanding maybe 60% of them at first), talking through ideas with the team, and writing code for data processing and AI model stuff. The people there knew so much. I spent a lot of time just listening and trying to absorb what they were saying. They were patient with me, which I appreciated.</p>
                    <p>I built a tool to visualize data from all the car's sensors—cameras, lidar, radar, ultrasonic—all in one place. Made it easier to spot when things were going wrong or when the data looked weird. It wasn't groundbreaking, but it was useful.</p>
                    <p>There was also this competition JLR runs for undergrads called the ACES Challenge. We came up with an idea for connecting convoy vehicles in a mesh network for security and communication. Built a simulation, got to demo it on actual vehicles. We won, got an award for Most Innovative. That was a good day.</p>

                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>JLR was intimidating at first. Everyone there seemed to know exactly what they were doing, and I was just trying to keep up. I learned a ton, mostly by asking a lot of questions and admitting when I didn't understand something. The ACES win was cool, but honestly it felt a bit lucky—we had a good idea at the right time. The real value was getting to work alongside people who were genuinely good at what they do and were willing to teach me.</p>

                    <p>I'm in my final year now—Masters year at Trinity. It's strange to think this is almost over.</p>
                    <p>My thesis is on transistor parasitic model extraction for GaN FETs. Basically trying to make device models more accurate. It's very specific, very technical. Some days I feel like I'm getting somewhere, other days I'm just staring at simulation results wondering if I messed something up.</p>
                    <p>Also working on a Vision Transformer for a hybrid Quantum Deep Learning network as coursework. It's new territory for me. Honestly, I'm still figuring out half of what I'm doing. But that's kind of the point, I guess.</p>

                    <p>It's weird being in the final year. Everything I've done kind of led here, but I'm not sure I feel ready for it to be over. The thesis work is hard—some days I make progress, other days I just stare at my screen. The quantum stuff is honestly over my head most of the time, but I'm trying. I guess that's all I can do. Looking back at everything—from that broken drone to now—it doesn't feel like this grand journey. It just feels like I kept showing up and trying things, even when I had no idea what I was doing. Maybe that's enough.</p>
