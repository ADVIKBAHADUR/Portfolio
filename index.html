                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>University wasn't just about grades for me—it was where I discovered my passion for bridging hardware and software. Every late night debugging FPGA code taught me resilience. The Laidlaw scholarship showed me that technical skills mean little without the ability to lead and inspire others.</p>

                    <h3>Genuine Reflections</h3>
                    <p>Each technology I learned was like adding a new tool to my toolbox. But the real skill was knowing when to use which tool. I learned that elegant solutions often come from understanding constraints deeply, not from using the fanciest tech.</p>

                    <p>My independent projects are where I truly grow. There's no syllabus, no deadline except my own curiosity. Building that drone taught me more about systems thinking than any textbook could. These projects keep me grounded—they remind me why I fell in love with engineering in the first place.</p>
